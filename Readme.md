## Data Structures
- `List<String>` → Stores words from the file
- `String[] WORDS` → Holds the words for the game
- `Set<Character> guesses` → Keeps track of guessed letters
- `char[] guessedWord` → Represents the current word state

---

## Problems
1) It can't read numbers because the program only accepts letters as valid input.
2) It doesn't have PNGs.
3) There might be a bug, but I didn't find one.
